🚀 Project Overview
---
This project is a self-hosted, offline DevOps lab created to simulate real-world CI/CD workflows without relying on cloud platforms like AWS or GCP.
It includes:

✔ Jenkins Pipeline (automated builds)

✔ Docker image build inside Jenkins container using Docker-in-Docker

✔ Kubernetes (kind cluster) for local deployment

✔ GitHub Actions for optional cloud CI

✔ Complete DevOps toolchain on your own machine

This setup is ideal for learning, experimenting, and showcasing DevOps skills in interviews.

🛠️ How Jenkins Pipeline Works
---
✔ Stage 1 — Checkout

Pulls latest code from GitHub.

✔ Stage 2 — Build Docker Image

Builds local image:

```
docker build -t anjalimishra/flask-devops-lab:latest .
```

✔ Stage 3 — Optional Deploy

Deploys to kind Kubernetes cluster:

```
kubectl apply -f k8s/
```
